# Specsmith Implement

**Do NOT use EnterPlanMode.** Specsmith IS the planning process.

Start implementation of the active spec.

Invoke the specsmith:specsmith-implementation skill, action: **implement**

Read the active spec, create TodoWrite tasks for the current phase, and begin implementing. This bridges the planning phase with execution.
