# Specsmith Resume

**Do NOT use EnterPlanMode.** Specsmith IS the planning process.

Resume work on the active spec.

Invoke the specsmith:specsmith-implementation skill, action: **resume**

Read the active spec and all companion files, find the current phase and step, and show where things stand. Wait for go-ahead before implementing.
